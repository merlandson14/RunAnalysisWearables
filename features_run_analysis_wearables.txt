# Variables in Datasets:

Subject -- Subject Identification Number
	(was V1 from subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt)
	(1-30)
Activity_Label -- Activity Label
	(was V1 from activity_train.txt and activity_test.txt)
	1 WALKING
	2 WALKING_USTAIRS
	3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4 SITTING
	5 STANDING
	6 LAYING
tGravAccMag-mean -- Gravity Acceleration mean
	(was V214 from original 561-variable dataset)
tGravAccMag-std -- Gravity Acceleration standard deviation
	(was V215 from original 561-variable dataset)
ave-tGravAccMag_mean -- Average of mean for each subject at each 	activity
ave-tGravAccMag_std -- Average of standard deviation for each 	subject at each activity

subjectTest -- data frame of 30% of subjects for testing
xtestData -- data frame of the 561-variable data for testing
ytestData -- data frame of six activities for testing
trainDF -- data frame of combined subject, activities and two 	variables (mean and std) for training data
testDF -- data frame of combined subject, activities and two variables (mean and std) for testing data
mergedData -- data frame of combined and sorted data for both 	training and testing
mergedDataActivity -- data frame of mergedData, regrouped by 	subject and activity
sumMergedData -- summary table of mergedDataActivity giving 	average of mean and std for each subject at each activity
